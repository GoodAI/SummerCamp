A liquid state machine (LSM) is a particular kind of spiking neural network.
A LSM consists of a large collection of units (called nodes, or neurons).
Each node receives time varying input from external sources (the inputs) as well as from other nodes.
Nodes are randomly connected to each other. The recurrent nature of the connections turns the time varying input into a spatio-temporal pattern of activations in the network nodes.
The spatio-temporal patterns of activation are read out by linear discriminant units.
The soup of recurrently connected nodes will end up computing a large variety of nonlinear functions on the input.
Given a large enough variety of such nonlinear functions, it is theoretically possible to obtain linear combinations (using the read out units) to perform whatever mathematical operation is needed to perform a certain task, such as speech recognition or computer vision.
The word liquid in the name comes from the analogy drawn to dropping a stone into a still body of water or other liquid.
The falling stone will generate ripples in the liquid.
The input (motion of the falling stone) has been converted into a spatio-temporal pattern of liquid displacement (ripples).
