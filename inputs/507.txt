A liquid state machine (LSM) is a particular kind of spiking neural network.
A LSM consists of a large collection of units (called nodes, or neurons).
Each node receives time varying input from external sources (the inputs) as well as from other nodes.
Nodes are randomly connected to each other. The recurrent nature of the connections turns the time varying input into a spatio-temporal pattern of activations in the network nodes.
The spatio-temporal patterns of activation are read out by linear discriminant units.
