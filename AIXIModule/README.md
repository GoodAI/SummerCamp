# Reinforcement learning node using Monte Carlo AIXI CTW algorithm.

Tutorial is [here](doc/).

This project was created for [GoodAI](http://goodai.com), during [Summer Camp](http://datalab.fit.cvut.cz/events/52-summer-camp-2015) at  [FIT CVUT](http://fit.cvut.cz/) by [Jiri Nadvornik](http://nadvornik.org/).  It was heavily inspired by [pyaixi](https://github.com/gkassel/pyaixi) by Geoff Kassel and [mc-aixi](https://github.com/moridinamael/mc-aixi) by Daniel Visentin and Marcus Hutter.
