# Summer Camp 2015
This repository contains three BrainSimulator modules which were developed during [Datalab Summer Camp](http://datalab.fit.cvut.cz/events/52-summer-camp-2015) organized by [CTU](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en). 

[GoodAI](http://www.goodai.com) supported students in their study and testing of the following research topics:

* [AIXI](AIXIModule/README.md)
* [Clockwork reccurrent neural networks](ClockWorkNNModule/README.md)
* [Liquid state machines](LSMModule/README.md)

Modules are standalone VS2013 solutions. For testing them, clone the repository and build a corresponding solution.
By default, solutions are configured to execute a standalone (binary) version of [BrainSimulator](http://www.goodai.com/#!brain-simulator/c81c)
but you can also link directly to sources of BrainSimulator available at [github](https://github.com/GoodAI/BrainSimulator).

System requirements are the same as for BrainSimulator, i.e. 64-bit Windows operating system, NVIDIA CUDA-enabled graphic card.
