# Summer Camp 2015
This repository contains three BrainSimulator modules which were developed during [Datalab Summer Camp](http://datalab.fit.cvut.cz/events/52-summer-camp-2015) orginised by [CTU](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en). 

[GoodAI](http://www.goodai.com) supported students to study and test following research topics:

* [AIXI](AIXIModule/README.md)
* [Clockwork reccurrent neural networks](ClockWorkNNModule/README.md)
* [Luquid state machines](LSMModule/README.md)

Modules are standalone VS2013 solutions. For testing them, clone the repository and build corresponding solution.
By default solutions are configured to execute standalone (binary) version of [BrainSimulator](http://www.goodai.com/#!brain-simulator/c81c)
but you can also link directly to sources of BrainSimulator available at [github](../BrainSimulator).

System requirements are same as for BrainSimulator, i.e. 64-bit Windows operating system, NVIDIA CUDA-enabled graphic card.
