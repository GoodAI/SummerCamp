# AIXIModule
MC-AIXI-CTW module for reinforcement learning in wide variety of environments, including  POMDP.

It will work in *worst case scenario*:
* unknown environment
* noisy observations
* stochastic effects of actions
* aliasing of perceptions
* no explicit notion of state
* rewards only sparsely distributed

...but it will take very long.
